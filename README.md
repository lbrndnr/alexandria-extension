# Alexandria
Alexandria is a browser extension that aims to improve user experience when reading academic papers. Eventually, it should support similar features like [Sioyek](https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek), just right in your browser :)

## Features
It currently supports the following features:
* Alexandria recognizes the paper and adds Google Scholar links to the tile and authors
* the bibliography is parsed and Google Scholar links added to each citation
* dark mode
* various shortcuts to zoom, download the document etc.

## Roadmap
Check out the issues for an in-depth roadmap. The most notable features include:
* improved figure support (show figures when hovering over Fig. 1a, make the floatable, etc.)
* custom search engine (e.g. Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar etc.)
