# Alexandria
Alexandria is a in-browser PDF viewer for academic papers. Its primary goal is to make papers easier to digest. It does so by providing simple but effective features.

## Features

Alexandria is aware of the paper you read. It parses its references and adds links to a citation's Google Scholar entry.

It also changes the tab's title, so that papers are easily destinguishable.

Figures can be clicked on to make the float over the article.

## Roadmap
Check out the issues for an in-depth roadmap. The most notable features include:
* improved figure support (show figures when hovering over Fig. 1a, make the floatable, etc.)
* custom search engine (e.g. Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar etc.)
